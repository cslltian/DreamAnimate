To summarize, our main contributions in this work are as follows:

We propose \textbf{DreamAnimate}, an innovative character animation framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by achieving fine-grained detail preservation and temporal consistency.

We design three key modules: Progressive Motion Estimation (PME), Global Affine Transformation (GAT), and Character Animation Fusion (CAF), to ensure precise motion alignment, realistic motion correspondence, and high-quality character animation. 

Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamAnimate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative comparisons, setting a new benchmark in character animation.
